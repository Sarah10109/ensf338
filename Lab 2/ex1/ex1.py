'''
The code gets an integer n and check if n is equal to 1 or 0. 
If not then it the functions calls it self as a recursion function. 
This code is finding the fibonacci sequence to the nths place.

'''
This example is a bad example of divide-and-conquer algorithm since 
it is creating a new problem without making the problem smaller.
The function does split up the work function into smaller parts which 
will go to smaller parts untill n reaches 1 or 0.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(2^n)
