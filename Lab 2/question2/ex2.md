## 1. Mention at least two aspects that make interpolation search better than binary search [0.1 pts]

## 2. Interpolation search assumes that data is uniformly distributed What happens this data follows a different distribution? Will the performance be affected? Why? [0.2 pts]

## 3. If we wanted to modify interpolation search to follow a different distribution, which part of the code would be affected? [0.1 pts]


## When comparing linear, binary and interpolation search:
## 4. When is linear search your only option for searching data as binary and interpolation search may fail? [0.2 pts]

## 5. In which case will linear search outperform both binary and interpolation search, and why? [0.2 pts]

## 6. Is there a way to improve binary and interpolation search to solve this issue? [0.2 pts]
