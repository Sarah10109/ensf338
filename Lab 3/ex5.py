# 1. Implement a standard binary search, with the following tweak: the
# midpoint for the first iteration must be configurable (all successive
# iterations will just split the array in the middle)


# 2. Time the performance of each search task w/ different midpoints
# for each task. You can use whatever strategy you want to check
# different midpoints. Then, choose the best midpoint for each task 

# 3. Produce a scatterplot visualizing each task and the corresponding
# chosen midpoint

# 4. Comment on the graph. Does the choice of initial midpoint appear
# to affect performance? Why do you think is that?
