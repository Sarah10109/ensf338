# Part 2.1 - Find the error

# What the code does:
    # The code takes an integer arguement from the command line and checks whether it is prime or not
    # If number < 2, 'No' will be printed, otherwise a for loop will iterate through a variable i for all numbers from 2 up to (but not including) number
    # If the remainder after dividing number by i is 0, 'No' is printed, indicating a composite number; otherwise, 'Yes' is printed, indicating a prime number 

# Error: There was a small syntax error. Here, at this line, print ('Yesâ€™), the right-side quotation mark was incorrect.  


# Code with fixed errors
