# Q1. List two possible ways to implemenent queue for finding a node in 
#     the algorithm


'''
Two possible ways to implement the queue:
    1. Array implementation
    2. Priority queue implementation using a heap
'''



# Q2. Implement two version of the algorithm, one with the inefficient
#     node selection logic, and one with the efficient node selection logic.





# Q3. Measure the performance of each algorithm on the sample graph
#     provided on the lab’s D2L (random.dot). [0.2 pts]
#       • Time the execution of the algorithm, for all nodes
#       • Report average, max and min time



# Q4. Plot a histogram of the distribution of execution times across all
#     nodes, and discuss the results
